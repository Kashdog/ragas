                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Next to Darbari kanada, Adana (or Adana kanada) is probably the best known variety of the Kanada group. A performance of raga Darbari kanada is often concluded with a composition in Adana, which in many respects may be considered its sparkling counterpart.</p><i class="blocks__content-close fa fa-close"></i>

                <h2>Info</h2>
                <p>Adana was a major raga in the 17th century and according to Faqirullah(1666) a combination of the then current ragas Kanada and Malhar. It appears in a well-known ragamala from Mewar as an ascetic with matted locks, seated on a tiger skin. However, Somanatha(1609) describes it as Kama, the god of love. His Adana was apparently quite different from the raga as it is performed today.</p><i class="blocks__content-close fa fa-close"></i>

                <h2>Style</h2>
                <p>Flat Ga is usually omitted in ascent, and in descent it always appears in the distinctive Kanada phrase k.G M R S. Flat Dha can be present in descent, but one should never linger on it. In fact, some musicians omit Dha altogether from this raga. Most of the movements in Adana are in the upper tetrachord, around the high Sa. It is very common to even begin elaborating this raga on high Sa, which is the dominant note.</p><i class="blocks__content-close fa fa-close"></i>

                <h2>Particulars</h2>
                <p>Adana has shades of Sarang and is suitable for vigorous expression. Most artists play a fast composition with only a short alap in this raga. Although Adana has the same tone material as raga Darbari kanada, its faster pace of rendition, less pronounced oscillation on Ga and weak Dha, as well as its focus on the upper part of the octave set it apart.</p><i class="blocks__content-close fa fa-close"></i>
